	<item>Understand derivatives and be able to evaluate them numerically, graphically, and symbolically</item>
	<item>Understand definite and indefinite integrals and be able to evaluate them numerically, graphically, and symbolically</item>
	<item>Use the ideas of limits, derivatives, and integrals to solve applied problems. In
particular, you will become skilled in using these ideas to solve related rate
problems, optimization problems, curve sketching problems, and area problems
and in identifying and modeling the physical situations in which these ideas are
useful.</item>
