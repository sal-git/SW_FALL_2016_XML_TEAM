<h3 align="center">Degree Title - Mathematics</h3>
<div>
<p>Mathematics is both an exact science and a highly creative endeavor; a field of study that develops problem‐solving skills and a passion for inquiry. Mathematics majors are surprisingly attractive to many professional branches in our society, particularly intelligence, technology, finance, security, engineering and physics. Mathematics Majors with Teacher Certification are attractive to the growing demand for teachers in high schools, middle schools and elementary schools. A BS in Mathematics will prepare the graduate for a competitive position in society and provide the necessary preparation graduate for an exciting and rewarding teaching position and for graduate studies. </p>
