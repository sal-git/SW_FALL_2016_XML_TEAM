  <Description>
    This course is a continuation of data structures topics covered in CSCI 2380. Content includes theoretical topics in 
    algorithmic efficiency and complexity, along with abstract data types, including graphs, networks, trees, and priority 
    queues. Search topics, including hashing, trees, external search trees (B-trees), and sorting algorithms including 
    external sorting are introduced and compared. Computational complexity topics include the class P and NP, NP-completeness 
    and reducibility, NP-completeness proofs, and NP-complete problems.
