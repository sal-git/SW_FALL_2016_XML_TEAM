<Description>
An introduction to some of the more important concepts, techniques, and structures of discrete mathematics. It provides a bridge between computer science and mathematics. Topics include functions and relations, sets, countability, groups, graphs, propositional and predicate calculus, and permutations and combinations. Students will be expected to develop simple proofs for problems drawn primarily from computer science and applied mathematics.
